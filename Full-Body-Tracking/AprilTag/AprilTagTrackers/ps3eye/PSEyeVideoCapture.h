/// Video capture class that prioritizes PS3 Eye devices.
/**
Device opening priority:
-CL Eye MultiCam (Win x86 only; user must have activated camera OR CL Eye Platform SDK Developer binaries)
-CL Eye Driver (Win x86 only)
-PS3EYEDriver (Win and OSX)
-OpenCV native

To prioritize custom PS3 Eye devices, we must override open().

For CL Eye MultiCam and PS3EYEDriver, we set the parent
Ptr< cv::IVideoCapture >icap member variable
to a custom cv::IVideoCapture object.

For CL Eye Driver, we use the native open to get the native icap member variable,
but we use custom cv::VideoCapture::set() and \ref get() to change parameters via registry settings.
